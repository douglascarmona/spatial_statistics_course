# Spatial Statistics Course

This repository holds the notebooks for spatial statistics course with Python.

## Running the notebooks

The dependencies used in this course are managed via [poetry](https://python-poetry.org). An introductory guide to start working with poetry can be found [here](https://cjolowicz.github.io/posts/hypermodern-python-01-setup/#setting-up-a-python-project-using-poetry). So, the way to install the project into a local environment is:

```bash
poetry install
```

and then, to run the notebooks using [JupyterLab](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/), just run:

```bash
poetry run jupyter-lab classes
```
